#ISMA 208
##Fall 2015, Emily Carr University of Art + Design

Lecture notes, class exercises, assignments, and projects for ISMA 208: *Programming for Creative Practice*.

ISMA 208 Second-level course focusing on using [Processing](http://processing.org) to learn how programming can be its own art practice or aid an existing practice, such as visualizing data and simulating patterns in a meaningful way. Or in a way that isn't meaningful at all. Up to you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Taught by Ben Bogart as part of the Interactive + Social Media major.

##opening and running files
Processing programs are called *sketches*. Both Processing's name itself and the name it gives its programs are unfortunate and confusing, so they will be referred to as programs. A program (.pde) needs to be in its original folder to run, even if said program does not have any associated files. 

The easiest way to compile it is to simply install the Processing IDE ([free](https://processing.org/download/)) and run it from there. Eclipse is also capable of highlighting and compiling Processing programs, which is made easier with [proclipsing](https://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/) (I know, who names this stuff?).
