#Assignment 3
Third of three homework assignments. Each assignment has 10 instructions which must be fulfilled with a Processing program.

A3_1. Draw a 4 x 4 grid using for loops.

A3_2. Make a button looking shape that changes colour if and only if clicked on by the mouse.

A3_3. Make two shapes that change colour when the opposite shape is pressed.

A3_4. Create an animation of a shape that moves across the screen and changes direction when it reaches the canvas bounds.

A3_5. Create an animation of a shape that moves across the screen and changes direction and colour when it reaches the canvas bounds. Ensure the shape position is reset when the mouse button is pressed.

A3_6. Use a for loop and a random number generator to draw 100 shapes.

A3_7. Create an animation of a circle that moves around the circumference of a larger circle.

A3_8. Use the angle of the smaller circle to the middle of the canvas to smoothly change the colour of the smaller circle. i.e. map the angle to the colour value in some way.

A3_9. Count the number of mouse presses in the canvas and use that to change the number of shapes drawn for each frame such that more mouse presses means more shapes.

A3_10. Create a motion graphic using cos and/or sin.
