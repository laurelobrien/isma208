#Assignment 2
Second of three short assignments, with 10 sets of directions that must be followed with a Processing program.

A2_1. Create a drawing program where the 'brush' changes colour depending on the position in the window.

A2_2. Change the fill and stroke of two shapes in different ways using mouseX, and mouseY.

A2_3. Create a program that draws two lines; each line starts in a separate corner of the canvas and ends at the mouseX, and mouseY position.

A2_4. Create a program that draws two shapes that move in relationship to the mouse in different ways.

A2_5. Create a program that draws one shape increasing in size at a rate dependent on the mouse position. Make sure the size of the shape wraps at some arbitrary value.

A2_6. Create a program that draws two vertical lines moving horizontally across the canvas.

A2_7. Using variables for x and y position, move four shapes across the canvas in different directions. Ensure the position of the shapes wrap around the canvas dimensions.

A2_8. Create a program with at least three different shapes that increase or decrease in size at different speeds. Ensure the size values wrap to some common maximum value.

A2_9. Create a shape that changes colour and size such that the rate of change is determined by the mouseX and mouseY position, respectively. Ensure the colour and size wrap around different arbitrary values.

A2_10. Create a motion graphics composition, which uses different shapes. Play with colour, size, and movement.
